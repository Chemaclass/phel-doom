## [Unreleased]

### Added

**Ammo loop (closes #5)**

- Finite reserve: start with 30 spare rounds, cap 50. HUD reads `ammo N/10 [R]`.
- Ammo-box pickups scale with the level's combat load (L1 2 boxes → L5 8). Yellow `A` on minimap, brown→yellow pulse in 3D, `+10` rounds each.
- Three layered reload cues: top-row `! LOW AMMO N !` pulse when total firepower drops to 3/2/1; periodic `press R to RELOAD` above the pistol (5s at mag 2, 3s at mag 1, 1s at mag 0); centred `CLICK` prompt on dry-fire (flips to `OUT OF AMMO` when reserve is dry).
- Reload now plays a 1.2s drop / refill / raise pistol animation with its own sfx. Trigger locked out for the window.

**Enemies**

- Per-level HP: L1 imp 1, L2 demon 2, L3 caco 3, L4 baron 4, L5 cyber 5. Body shades darker as HP drops; a yellow HP digit floats above the head 1.2s after each hit. Distinct `:wound` sfx so "I hit them" sounds different from "they hit me".

**HUD + map**

- Game-info strip (`L1 imps · kills · ammo`) lives top-left under the hearts row. Pos / angle / fps moved into the F3 debug overlay. Bottom row is now a single dim tagline.
- Minimap auto-scales on narrow terminals so it never claims more than ~1/3 of the screen width.
- Pause menu lists every key binding (move, turn, fire, reload, about-face, map, sound, debug, resume, quit).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- F3 toggles a per-frame perf overlay (frame-ms, cast-ms, render-ms, bytes emitted, avg RLE run-length, PHP memory). Off by default and fully gated, so the off path pays zero overhead. The canonical way to validate future cast/render optimisations. Closes #9.
- 10-round magazine + R-to-reload. Empty mags drop the trigger silently; HUD shows `ammo N/10` (amber under 3, red on empty). Phase 1 of issue #5 — reloads are free for now; finite ammo from map pickups comes in phase 2.

### Performance

- DDA raycaster replaces the fixed-step march in `cast-ray` / `cast-ray-hit`. ~20-24% faster cast phase across all viewports (`80×24` 0.81 → 0.65 ms, `120×30` 1.26 → 0.99 ms, `180×40` 2.04 → 1.55 ms). As a side-effect `cast-frame` now also surfaces `:hxs` / `:hys` (hit-cell coords) so the renderer's brick-texture hash gets real inputs. Closes #2.

### Investigated, not shipping

- **Differential rendering** (issue #3) — evaluated, closed without merge. Bench shows ~60 % bytes saved in still-but-animating scenes and 100 % saved on pause, but a 2 % regression once the player moves or turns. Active gameplay = net loss; complexity cost not justified. Full numbers + rationale in `docs/performance.md` *Evaluated and shelved*.
- **Sprite occlusion z-buffer** (issue #4) — evaluated, closed without merge. Going from 0 to 15 overlapping enemies adds ~0.3-0.8 ms to `frame->string` total; a best-case z-buffer would shave a fraction of that already-tiny slice while introducing a paint-order/fill-order invariant. Existing `:dists` + `:edists` + back-to-front sort already cover most of the proposed savings. Numbers + rationale in `docs/performance.md` *Evaluated and shelved*.

### Changed

- "Enemy behind you" warning radius tightened from 10 to 5 world-units so the cue fires only when something is genuinely close behind. Closes #6.

### Fixed

- Pause menu credits row: right border now renders white like the other rows (was gray because the dim attribute leaked through the SGR reset). Closes #8.
- Pause now freezes every time-driven animation: door blink on the 2D map, "‹ behind ›" warning, JAMMED label, low-life heart pulse, pickup throb, enemy face/body walk cycle, and the aggro-head pulse. Render samples a pause-aware `:game-time` clock instead of wall-clock `microtime`, and terminal-side `SGR 5` blinks were replaced with code-driven swaps so the freeze is observable. Closes #7.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-22

### Added

- 256-color ANSI raycaster, runs in any modern terminal.
- FPS combat: pistol, jam mechanic, knockback, kill streaks.
- Enemies with AI, hit reactions, and procedural levels with doors.
- Pickups: hearts (refill life), armor.
- Horror layer: heartbeat vignette, jump-scares, behind-you warning, atmospheric haze, blood drops, eyes on doors, lights flicker, silence-before-strike.
- Minimap, HUD (pos / angle / level / kills / fps), start menu, pause menu.
- Persisted scores.
- WAD parser (DOOM `.wad` reader).
- Sound on/off toggle.

### Performance

- `cast + render` under 5 ms per frame at 120×30.
- Flat PHP arrays on hot paths; `:tag` types for OPcache JIT tracing.
